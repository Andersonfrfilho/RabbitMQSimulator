# RabbitMQ Simulator #

The RabbitMQ Simulator is a web based tool that can be used to represent messaging topologies on a blank canvas.

The idea is to be able to drag & drop components like _Exchanges_, _Queues_, _Producers_ and _Consumers_ and be able to interconect them by drawing lines to represent bindings and so on.

Here's how a messaging topology represneted with the simulator looks like:

And you can see it in action in this video: [https://vimeo.com/56986242](https://vimeo.com/56986242)

## Possible Uses ##

- Teaching RabbitMQ concepts at conferences for example
- Topology Design that can be imported into RabbitMQ
- Debugging. By importing a topology from RabbitMQ the Simulator can be used as a message flow visualizer

## Features ##

The simulator currently implements the following features:

- Three exchange types: direct, fanout and topic:
- Queue Bindings and Exchange to Exchange bindings
- Publishers that can specify payload, routing key and publish interval, like "publish 1 message every 2 seconds"
- Message queueing
- Round-robin message delivery
- Default "Anon" exchange representation
- Export topology for a "play only" mode (useful for tutorials)

# Running the Simulator #

This project depends on _node.js_ and various node libraries for building the source files, therefore you will need to install node on your machine if you want to run it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RabbitMQSimulator/RabbitMQSimulator.git
cd RabbitMQSimulator
npm install
```

Once you have everything in place you can run the `node.js` app by calling:

```bash
node app.js
```

Then open [http:localhost:3000](http:localhost:3000).

If you want to be able to **import/export** from RabbitMQ then a broker needs to be running on _localhost_, with the management plugin enabled. At the moment the simulator uses the default `guest:guest` credentials but that will be fixed in the future.

# TODO #

- Improve components visual representation. Now they can only be distiguishe by color. They should have a different shape.
- Improve form usability for the different components.
- Fix login credentials for the RabbitMQ Management API.
- â€¦
